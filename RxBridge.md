# Introduction #
The RX Bridge is an ArbotiX add-on board that enables control of DX/RX/EX series servos.

# Setup #
  1. Remove jumper J1 from your ArbotiX to decouple the rx and tx lines of the serial port.
  1. Plug the RX-Bbridge into the ArbotiX. The outer 3-pin header plugs into the row of pins marked S1, which previously were jumpered with J1
  1. Use the standoff to connect the RX-Bridge securely

# Software #
Before uploading code, simply select **ArbotiX w/ RX Shield** as your board type.

That's it! You're now setup to use RX servos just like you used to use AX servos with your ArbotiX.
